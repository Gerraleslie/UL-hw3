1. First, clone all my files and dataset from my Git repository:
link: https://github.com/Gerraleslie/UL-hw3
command: git clone git@github.com:Gerraleslie/UL-hw3.git
then, you can download all .ipynb files and dataset for reproducing this project.

2. Reproduce as following steps:
#1 For Clustering test: Cancer EM clustering.ipynb/Cancer K clustering.ipynb/Winequality-red K clustering.ipynb/Winequality-red EM clustering.ipynb. 
     these four .ipynb files are for clustering on the two datasets.
#2 For Dimensionality Reduction, Cancer Dimensionality reduction.ipynb/Winequality-red Dimensionality reduction.ipynb.
     these two .ipynb files are code for DR on the two datasets respectively.
#3 Cancer Dimensionality reduction clustering.ipynb/Winequality-red Dimensionality reduction clustering.ipynb
     these two .ipynb files are for clustering with Dimensionality Reduction on two datasets.
#4 Cancer nn cluster.ipynb/Cancer nn DR.ipynb.
     these two .ipynb files are for the last section: implementing DR and Clustering on the Neural Network in Assignment 1

3. External libraries required:
pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn

4. All the code files are jupyter notebook type, do run their cells in order.
